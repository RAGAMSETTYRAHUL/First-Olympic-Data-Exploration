                                                           Data Analysis On Olympic Dataset 

**1. Problem Understanding:**

**Objective**: To analyze Olympic data and extract meaningful insights, focusing on trends, players, sports, and medal distribution.

**Key Questions**:

1.How has the number of sports evolved over time?

2.Which countries and players dominate in terms of medals?

3.What are the gender distribution trends in Olympic participation?

**2. Data Collection:**

**Dataset**: Downloaded an Olympic dataset containing over 200,000 records.

**Source**: A publicly available dataset or Kaggle dataset providing historical Olympic records.

**3. Data Preprocessing (ETL Operations):**

**Extraction:**

Loaded the raw dataset into Python using Pandas and into MySQL for querying.

**Transformation:**

**Cleaning:** Removed duplicate records, null values, and inconsistencies in column names and formats.

**Normalization:** Standardized date formats, athlete names, and event data.

**Outlier Removal**: Filtered out improbable values in age, medal counts, or sports categories.

**Loading:**

Inserted the cleaned and processed data into a MySQL database for analysis.

**4. Data Analysis**

**SQL Queries:**

Queried the database to calculate key metrics:

1.Total Games, Count of Sports, Total Players, and Count of Medals.

2.Medal counts by countries and players.

3.Sports trends across decades.

**Python:**

*Used Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn for additional statistical analysis and visualization.

**Power BI:**

Imported the dataset for interactive visualizations and creating a professional dashboard.

**5. Dashboard Creation (Using Power BI)**

**Interactive Filters:**

Enabled filters for Season (Summer/Winter), Age, and Medal Type.

**KPI Tiles:**

Displayed key metrics like **Total Games, Total Players, Count of Sports, and Medal Counts.**

**Visualizations:**

**Bar Charts:** Displayed sports trends over years and medal counts by players.

**Map Charts:**:Represented medal distribution across countries.

**Pie Chart:** Highlighted gender distribution among athletes.

**6. Insights Derived**

**Sports Trends:**

The number of sports has increased significantly post-1950, reflecting the Olympic Games' evolution.

**Top Countries:**

Certain countries (e.g., USA, Russia) dominate medal counts.

**Athlete Performance:**

Michael Phelps is the top-performing athlete with the most medals.

**Gender Trends:**

Male athletes still dominate participation, but female participation has been growing steadily.

**7. Tools and Technologies:**

Database Management: MySQL for querying and storing data.

Data Preprocessing: Python (Pandas) and MS Excel for cleaning and organizing data.

Visualization: Power BI for interactive and insightful dashboards.

**8. Challenges:**

1.Handling missing or inconsistent data during preprocessing.

2.Designing an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard for multiple audiences.

3.Optimizing SQL queries for faster data retrieval.

**9. Project Deliverables:**

1.A fully functional Power BI dashboard showcasing key Olympic data insights.

2.SQL queries for in-depth analysis.

3.Documented insights and learnings for presenting to stakeholders.
